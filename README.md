# Amazon-Price-Checker - Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup 4
This project checks daily the price of a product on Amazon. If it's below a certain price I receive an email alerting me which also contains the page link for fast purchase.
I've utilised Python, Gmail, SMTPLIB and Beautiful Soup 4 to get everything working.
